Littletitan is a project built upon [torchtitan](https://github.com/pytorch/torchtitan), with a focus on MoE pretraining.

My ultimate goal is to reproduce the infra part of [deepseek v3](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3/blob/main/DeepSeek_V3.pdf), which is really cool. I'm not sure if I can do it, but I'll try my best.
